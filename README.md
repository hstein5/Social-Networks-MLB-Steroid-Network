# Social-Networks-MLB-Steroid-Network

As life-long baseball fans, the following report is motivated by our team’s love for the
game and dives into a scandal that transformed the way the game had been played prior to the
release of the Mitchell Report. In the following analysis, we report our findings on the Mitchell
Report as a social network, by analyzing three separate networks: a network of all players,
connected by their relationships with the same drug dealers; a network of all drug dealers,
connected by the players who got their drugs from them; and a network of both players and
dealers, representing the spread of drugs and information throughout the Major League baseball
community. We will begin by exploring each of these three networks, looking at structure and
network statistics for players and dealers within each network. We will then dive into how these
different relationships among players and dealers contribute to a player’s career performance and
whether or not certain dealers are more likely to be connected to better players.

More specifically, we will examine what the MLB steroid network looks like, analyzing
differentiating factors between both players in terms of performance and suppliers in terms of
quality of drug, quantified by user performance. We will look into whether there is an obvious
enhancement in performance for players in our network, examining whether or not the Mitchell
Report found that there was a serious impact on player performance.
